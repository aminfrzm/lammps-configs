# IMPORTANT NOTE: When the input script line that defines a variable of
# style {equal} or {atom} that contain a formula is encountered, the
# formula is NOT immediately evaluated and the result stored.  See the
# discussion below about "Immediate Evaluation of Variables" if you want
# to do this.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: When a variable command is encountered in the input
# script and the variable name has already been specified, the command
# is ignored.  This means variables can NOT be re-defined in an input
# script (with 2 exceptions, read further).  This is to allow an input
# script to be processed multiple times without resetting the variables;
# see the "jump"_jump.html or "include"_include.html commands.  It also
# means that using the "command-line switch"_Section_start.html#2_6 -var
# will override a corresponding index variable setting in the input
# script.
