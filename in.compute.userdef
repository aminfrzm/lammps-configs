# User defined compute
# Computes calculate one of three styles of quantities: global,
# per-atom, or local.
# "atom" in the name: produce atom style variable
# "local" in the name: produce atom local variable
#  with neither "atom" or "local" in the name: produce global
#  quantities.

# | c_ID       | entire scalar, vector, or array            |
# | c_ID[I]    | one element of vector, one column of array |
# | c_ID[I][J] | one element of array                       |

# LAMMPS creates its own computes internally for thermodynamic output.
# Three computes are always created, named "thermo_temp",
# "thermo_press", and "thermo_pe", as if these commands had been
# invoked in the input script:
